# Palindrome Number - LeetCode Problem Solution
## Problem Description
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
## Solution.
In this problem, we need to check whether a given integer is a palindrome or not. A palindrome number is a number that reads the same backward as forward.




We can solve this problem by converting the given integer to a string, then checking if the string is a palindrome or not. We can also solve this problem without converting the integer to a string, by reversing the integer and checking if the reversed integer is equal to the original integer.
## Algorithm

=Convert the given integer to a string.


=Reverse the string.


=Check if the reversed string is equal to the original string.

## complexity analysis


Time complexity: O(log n), where n is the given integer.



Space complexity: O(1).


## Conclusion





In this problem, we learned how to check whether a given integer is a palindrome or not. We solved the problem by converting the integer to a string, as well as by reversing the integer. Both solutions have time complexity O(log n) and space complexity O(1).
